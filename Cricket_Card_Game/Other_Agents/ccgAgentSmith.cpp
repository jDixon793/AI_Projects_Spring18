// YOUR NAME:

// CS 4318, spring 2017
// Agent Challenge 4: Cricket card game
//
// Rename this file and the function below.  For example, if your agent name
// is Jones, rename this ccgAgentSmith.cpp file to ccgAgentJones.cpp and the
// ccgAgentSmith function below to ccgAgentJones.  Complete your agent
// function and turn it in on Blackboard.  Random-number generation is not
// allowed; your agent must be entirely deterministic.  Feel free to create
// other agents--each in a separate .cpp file--for yours to play against,
// but turn in only one.  Test your agent(s) with
//
//    nice bash ccgBuild.bash
//
// and then
//
//    nice ./ccgRunSim
//
// Each submitted agent will play each other, batting first and batting
// second an equal number of times, to determine the standings, which will
// be posted soon after the agents are due.

#include "ccg.h"

// Rename and complete this agent function.
int ccgAgentSmith(Hand hand, Card lastBowledCard, bool isBatting, const MatchState &match)
{
   // Your function must end up returning a valid int between 0 and numCardsPerHand - 1.
   // No random-number generation allowed!
   // hand.getCard(0) gives the first card in your hand.
   // hand.getCard(0).getNumber() gives the number of that card, 1 to 11.
   // hand.getCard(0).getSuit() gives the suit of that card.
   // match.getRuns(0) gives the number of runs scored by player A so far.
   // numRuns(d) gives the number of runs scored when the card difference is d.
   // See the definitions of Hand, Card and MatchState for more helpful functions.

/*

 - First, carefully comment your code above.
 - Here, describe your approach and why you expect it to do well against the
   other submitted agents.
 - Also make a note here if you talked about the assignment with anyone or gave
   or received any kind of help.
