// Agent Challenge 1: Rock, paper, scissors

// Rename this file and the function below.  For example, if your agent name
// is Jones, rename this rpsAgentSmith.cpp file to rpsAgentJones.cpp and the
// rpsAgentSmith function below to rpsAgentJones.  Complete your agent
// function and turn it in on Blackboard.  Feel free to create other
// agents--each in a separate .cpp file--for yours to compete against, but
// turn in only one.  Test your agent(s) with
//
//    nice bash rpsBuild.bash
//
// and then
//
//    nice ./rpsRunSim
//
// Each submitted agent will play each other in contests of some number of
// rounds each (at least 100) to determine the standings, which will be
// posted soon after the agents are due.
